# A Collection of My Implemnetations of Data Strctures and Algorithsm in Java
  This repository contains all my personal java Data Structures and Algorithms. Many of these are already included the java standard libraries but were created for the purpose of learning. However, several of these files were created out of necessity for certain projects I was working on. Many of the files are documented, however, the degree of documentation varies heavily. Some of the data structures and algorithms this project contains are lists, trees, sorting algorithms, etc.  
### Prerequisites

If you wish to download and use any of these classes separately, note that many of them depend on each other. However, this issue can most likely be fixed by replacing my data structures with the data structures in Java's standard library. For example,

```
import list.Vector;
```
can be replace with

```
import java.util.ArrayList;
```
